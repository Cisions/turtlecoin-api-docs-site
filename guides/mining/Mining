<p><strong>Please note:</strong> Unfortunately because of some bad people using mining software in malware, most antivirus software will detect the programs below as unsafe. </p>

<p>It is <strong>likely</strong> you will need to add exceptions and exclusions to your antivirus software in order to make things work properly. </p>

<p>Unless you know what you are doing, please <strong><em>only</em></strong> download from the links below.</p>

<p>There are currently a few different ways in which you can start mining TurtleCoin:</p>
<h3 id='1-xmr-stak'>1. <a href="https://github.com/fireice-uk/xmr-stak">XMR-Stak</a></h3>
<p>XMR-Stak is a unified miner, which means the same program will be used to mine with both your CPU and your GPU. It will automatically detect your hardware and adjust the settings accordingly.</p>

<p>Please follow <a href="XMR-Stak-Guide">this guide</a> to start mining TurtleCoin with XMR-Stak.</p>

<h3 id='2-xmrig'>2. <a href="https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig">XMRig</a></h3>
<p>XMRig is a little bit different to XMR-Stak, you need to download a CPU and GPU miner separately and run two separate instances in your computer. One will use your CPU and the other one will use your GPU. </p>
