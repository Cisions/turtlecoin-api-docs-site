It may also cause the phone to overheat and result in premature silicon degradation, shortening the lifespan of your phone.</h3>
<p>This guide will get you started mining TurtleCoin on a mobile phone.</p>

<p><em>Currently only available on Android version 4.1(Jelly Bean, year 2012) and newer</em></p>
<h2 id='setup'>Setup</h2>
<p>To mine TurtleCoin, we&#39;ll use the Tony Monero app.</p>

<ol>
<li>Download the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ethics.path.tonymonero">Tony Monero</a> app from the Google Play Store.</li>
<li>Upon downloading and installing, open the app.</li>
<li>Read through the agreement and accept/decline(the <code>EXIT</code> button). To use it, you will have to accept the agreement.</li>
<li>Press the play button on the top right and wait for the application to test your device</li>
<li>If your device is supported, you will be brought to a screen with a success message.</li>
<li>Check <a href="#tony-xmr-config">Tony Monero Configuration</a></li>
</ol>

<p>You should note that by using the Tony Monero app, you will be contributing 10% of your hashpower to the developers wallet (while you are mining)</p>

<ol>
<li>Leave <code>Profile selection</code> as default for now.</li>
<li>Enter your TurtleCoin wallet address</li>
<li>Enter a pool of your choice. To view a list of pools, you can go <a href="Pools">here</a></li>
<li>Enter the password of the pool. For most, it will be <code>x</code></li>
<li>Specify how many cores you want to use. We recommend using half of how many cores your phone has. So if your phone has 8 cores, enter <code>4</code></li>
<li>Click on the image with the three triangles (<code>&lt;1&lt;1&lt;1</code>) and tap the 2nd image from the right on the top row, for TurtleCoin</li>
<li>Make sure <code>Criptonight-lite support (Like AEON)</code> is checked.</li>
<li>Press the play button on the top right</li>
</ol>
<h2 id='expected-results'>Expected Results</h2>
<p>The miner should now start mining, and the stats displayed show start updating, displaying your hashrate and the like(it may take a few minutes to update)</p>

<p>You can tap the question marks on the right if you&#39;re unsure of what each value means</p>
