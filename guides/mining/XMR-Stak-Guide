<p>XMR-Stak is a unified miner, which means the same program will be used to mine with both your CPU and your GPU. It will automatically detect your hardware and adjust the settings accordingly.</p>
<h2 id='downloading-and-installing-for-windows'>Downloading and Installing for Windows</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>Download and install <a href="https://github.com/fireice-uk/xmr-stak/releases/latest">XMR-Stak Unified Miner</a>. It will auto-detect your hardware, and tune everything for you.</p></li>
<li><p>Make a folder called <code>TurtleCoin Miner</code> on your Desktop and unzip the files you just downloaded for XMR-Stak in there.</p></li>
<li><p>Double-click on <code>xmr-stak.exe</code>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>##### To start XMR-Stak without using your CPU/GPU, follow these steps:<a name="xmr-stak-no-cpu-gpu"></a></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Open Command Prompt</p></li>
<li><p>Type <code>cd Desktop\TurtleCoin Miner</code></p>

<ul>
<li>To start XMR-Stak without utilising the CPU, type <code>xmr-stak.exe --noCPU</code></li>
<li>To start XMR-Stak without utilizing your nVidia GPU, type <code>xmr-stak.exe --noNVIDIA</code></li>
<li>To start XMR-Stak without utilizing your AMD GPU, type <code>xmr-stak.exe --noAMD</code></li>
<li>To start XMR-Stak without utilizing either of your GPU&#39;s, type <code>xmr-stak.exe --noAMD --noNVIDIA</code></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>If you want to use both your CPU and your GPU, ignore these steps. Just launch <code>xmr-stak.exe</code></strong></p></li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li><p>Click <code>Yes</code> when it asks if you want to run as Administrator. This is so that the program can see what hardware you&#39;re running.</p></li>
<li><p>Check <a href="#setup-and-config">XMR-Stak Setup and Configuration</a></p></li>

<p>Upon first launching XMR-Stak, the software will ask you several setup and configuration questions.</p>

<ol>
<li><code>Please enter: - Do you want to use the HTTP interface? Unlike the screen display, browser interface is not affected by the GPU lag. If you don&#39;t want to use it, please enter 0, otherwise enter port number that the miner should listen on</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Enter <code>0</code>, if you are like most people, and do not need to remotely check your hashrate.</p>

<p>If you do need to, then enter a port number. 
Let&#39;s take the port number as <code>0101</code> and your IP address as <code>26.24.105.14</code> as an example.</p>

<p>To check the hashrate, enter in the address bar of your web browser, <code>&lt;26.24.105.14&gt;:&lt;0101&gt;</code>. It should show a page with your rig&#39;s hashrate.
If you are checking from the same IP address, you can alternatively enter, <code>localhost:&lt;0101&gt;</code></p>

<p>Make sure to enter your own IP address if you enable this feature. You can choose any port you want!</p>

</ul>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>Enter `cryptonight_lite_v7`

3. `- Pool address: e.g. pool.example.com:3333`

   Choose a pool from any of the [available pools](Pools) that is **closest to you** and enter its URL (you will be able to add more later).

4. `- Username (Wallet address or pool login):`  

If you have not yet downloaded and ran the TurtleCoin core software to sync the blockchain and create a wallet, you can make a [paper wallet](Making-a-Paper-Wallet) to start mining towards now, and import the wallet later.

5. `- Password (mostly empty or x):`  

Enter `x`.

6. `- Rig identifier for pool-side statistics (needs pool support). Can be empty:`

Leave it empty and press enter.

7. `- Does this pool port support TLS/SSL? Use no if unknown. (y/N)`  

In most cases, `N` is fine.

8. `- Do you want to use nicehash on this pool? (y/n)`  

Enter `n`(in case you do, enter `y`).

9. `- Do you want to use multiple pools? (y/n)`  

* Enter `y` if you would like to add more pools. 
* Give them all a weight of `10` if you're tired of reading, or if you want the best experience, give the pools nearest to you a higher number, and the ones further from you a lower number.  
* XMR-Stak will prioritize the highest weight pool, and fall back to the others if it cannot connect.
* If they are all given the same weight, it will connect to them in order of how they are listed, form top to bottom, in the configuration file.
* If you are on Windows 7/8, it will ask for administrator permission again. Click `Yes` to grant it permission.
* If you are on Windows 10, it will not ask for it again.



Done! The miner will now start scanning your hardware and will begin mining. Awesome!



XMR-Stak will save your configuration in `config.txt`  in the same directory from which it was first run. 
Your configuration for pools(algorithm to mine, address, port etc) will be saved in `pools.txt`
The configuration of the device it mines(CPU/AMD/NVIDIA) will be saved in `cpu.txt`, `amd.txt` or `nvidia.txt`, respectively.



Run XMR-Stak again from the same directory to reuse the configuration.
