<p>Go to <a href="https://turtlecoin.lol/wallet">this link</a> and follow these steps-</p>

<ul>
<li>Click on <code>Generate a Wallet</code></li>
<li>Mash your keyboard and start entering a bunch of random letters, numbers and signs in the field. Make sure you toggle on Caps Lock repeatedly! (Don&#39;t go too crazy - otherwise you might end up shutting down your PC!)</li>
<li>After you&#39;re done mashing your keyboard, press <code>Generate Wallet</code></li>
<li>The letters and numbers in the green box, starting with <code>TRTL</code>, is your public address. You can share it freely. We recommend <a href="Using-trtlbot-plus-plus#registering-your-wallet">registering it with trtlbot++</a> in the Discord so that you can access it easily.<br></li>
<li>Save the <code>Seed Phrase</code>, the 25 words in the red box, safely. <strong>DO NOT SHARE IT WITH ANYONE</strong>. <strong>Anyone who has access to this can <em>access your funds</em> and has <em>complete control</em> over your wallet.</strong></li>
<li>Save the <code>Spend Key</code> and the <code>View Key</code>, the two very long strings of (seemingly) random letters and numbers, safely.  <strong>DO NOT SHARE IT WITH ANYONE</strong>. <strong>Anyone who has access to this can <em>access your funds</em> and has <em>complete control</em> over your wallet.</strong></li>
