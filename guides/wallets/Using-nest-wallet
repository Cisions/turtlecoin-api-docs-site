<p>Nest Wallet automatically synchronizes from a Public Node, ensuring that you quickly sync with the network and that excessive storage is not used up.</p>

<p>If you would rather sync from a local copy of the blockchain, select <code>Local blockchain</code> before opening your wallet.</p>

<p><img src="/guides/wallets/images/nest_make.png" alt="create" /></p>

<p>Next to it will be another box. In it, type a password to protect your wallet. You will need to enter it every time you open the wallet. Make sure to choose a strong one! <em>There is no confirmation, type it carefully!</em></p>

<p>Once done, press <code>CREATE</code>.</p>
<h3 id='opening-a-wallet'>Opening a Wallet</h3>
<p>Upon opening Nest Wallet, you will be greeted with a screen.</p>

<p>On the screen will be written <code>Open an existing wallet</code>.</p>

<p><img src="/guides/wallets/images/nest_open.png" alt="open" /></p>

<p>Under it will be a box.</p>

<p>Click on the box, File Explorer should open up. Navigate to where your <code>xxx.wallet</code> file is saved and open it.</p>

<p>Next to it, enter the password you set while making the wallet.</p>

<h3 id='viewing-wallet-address'>Viewing Wallet Address</h3>
<p>Upon opening your wallet, your wallet address will be in the middle of the wallet screen. Press the button next to it to copy it to your clipboard.</p>

<p><img src="/guides/wallets/images/nest-address.png" alt="address" /></p>
<h3 id='exporting-keys'>Exporting Keys</h3>
<p>Each TurtleCoin  wallet is, essentially, just a pair of keys (<em>View Key</em> and <em>Spend Key</em>) from which the public address is derived.</p>

<p>It is <strong>very</strong> important to export these keys and back them up somewhere that is safe and secure (meaning somewhere reliable/permanent that no one else can access).</p>

<p>In the event of a lost or corrupted wallet file, computer crash, etc., the <strong>View Key</strong> and <strong>Spend Key</strong> are the <em>only</em> way to restore a wallet and recover the funds it holds. </p>

<p><strong>DO NOT SHARE IT WITH ANYONE</strong>. <strong>Anyone who has these can <em>access your funds</em> and has <em>complete control</em> over your wallet.</strong></p>

<p>To back up your View Key and Spend Key, follow these steps-</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Click on <code>Wallet</code> on the top left</p></li>
<li><p>Click on <code>Backup wallet</code></p></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/guides/wallets/images/nest-backup1.png" alt="backup" /></p>

<ul>
<li>A window like this should appear-</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/guides/wallets/images/nest-backup2.png" alt="backup" /></p>

<ul>
<li>Copy and safely store the <code>Private View Key</code> and <code>Private Spend Key</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id='viewing-wallet-balance'>Viewing Wallet Balance</h3>
<p>Upon opening your wallet, your balance will be on the top of the wallet screen.</p>

<p><img src="/guides/wallets/images/nest-balance.png" alt="balance" /></p>
<h3 id='sending-turtlecoin-transactions'>Sending TurtleCoin Transactions</h3>
<p>Upon opening your wallet, in the bottom right will be written <code>TRANSFER</code>.</p>

<p>To send a transaction, enter the recipient&#39;s address under <code>Recipient address</code>  and the amount you want to send under <code>Amount</code>.</p>

<p>Because transactions on the TurtleCoin blockchain are privatized, in 
some situations a payment ID is necessary for the recipient to be able 
to determine where the payment came from, for instance when depositing 
to an exchange or other service.</p>

<p>Usually the service/recipient will generate and provide the required payment ID.</p>

<p>To include a Payment ID, simply enter it under <code>(optional) Payment ID</code>.</p>

<p><img src="/guides/wallets/images/nest-tx.png" alt="send" /></p>
<h4 id='changing-mixin-and-fee'>Changing Mixin and Fee</h4>
<p>Currently, it is not possible to change the mixin (set to 4) or fee (set to 1 TRTL). This may be possible in the future. </p>

<p>For now remember, that 1 TRTL ontop of what you&#39;re sending will be deducted. So don&#39;t send your full balance!</p>

<p>### Saving the Wallet</p>

<p>To safely close the wallet, simply close it as you normally would; by clicking the <code>X</code> at the top right/left, depending on your OS.</p>
<h3 id='recovering-your-wallet'>Recovering Your Wallet</h3><h4 id='private-view-and-spend-keys'>Private View and Spend Keys</h4>
<p>If you want to recover your wallet with your Private View and Spend Key, it is relatively easy.</p>

<p>Upon opening Nest Wallet, <em>in the boxes under <code>Import wallet from keys</code></em>-</p>

<ul>
<li>enter the name you want to give your wallet</li>
<li>enter the password you want to encrypt your wallet with</li>
<li>enter your View and Spend key in the bottom two boxes</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/guides/wallets/images/nest-recover.png" alt="restore" /></p>

<p>Once done, click <code>IMPORT</code>. The wallet will be restored and begin syncing with the blockchain.</p>
