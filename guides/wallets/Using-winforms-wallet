<h2 id='synchronizing-the-blockchain'>Synchronizing the Blockchain</h2>
<p>Running <code>TurtleWallet.exe</code> will automatically open <code>walletd.exe</code> and begin synchronizing with the blockchain.</p>

<p>Because the blockchain is constantly growing, the file size is always increasing, and <code>TurtleCoind.exe</code> must verify each block (CPU intensive). </p>

<p>To save time, consider downloading a cached &#39;bootstrap&#39; of the blockchain (see <a href="Bootstrapping-the-Blockchain">Bootstrapping the Blockchain</a> for more info).</p>

<h3 id='viewing-wallet-address'>Viewing Wallet Address</h3>
<p>Upon opening your wallet the address is in the middle of the page.</p>

<p>To copy it, you can click on the button which says <code>Copy Address</code>.</p>

<p><img src="/guides/wallets/images/winf-add.png" alt="address" /></p>
<h3 id='exporting-keys'>Exporting Keys</h3>
<p>Each TurtleCoin  wallet is, essentially, just a pair of keys (<em>View Key</em> and <em>Spend Key</em>) from which the public address is derived.</p>

<p>It is <strong>very</strong> important to export these keys and back them up somewhere that is safe and secure (meaning somewhere reliable/permanent that no one else can access). </p>

<p>In the event of a lost or corrupted wallet file, computer crash, etc., the <em>View Key</em> and <em>Spend Key</em> are the only way to restore a wallet and recover the funds it holds.</p>

<p><strong>DO NOT SHARE IT WITH ANYONE</strong>. <strong>Anyone who has these can <em>access your funds</em> and has <em>complete control</em> over your wallet.</strong></p>

<p>To back up your keys, follow these steps-</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Upon opening your wallet, click <code>BACKUP KEYS</code>, located at the bottom of your wallet.</p></li>
<li><p>Enter your wallet password and press <code>Unlock Keys</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Save your View Key and Spend key in a safe and secure place.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/guides/wallets/images/winf-keys.png" alt="backup" /></p>
<h3 id='viewing-wallet-balance'>Viewing Wallet Balance</h3>
<p>Upon opening your wallet, your balance is located in the top right.</p>

<p><img src="/guides/wallets/images/winf-balance.png" alt="balance" /></p>
<h3 id='sending-turtlecoin-transactions'>Sending TurtleCoin Transactions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Upon opening your wallet, in the bottom right will be written <code>SEND TRTL</code>, click it.</li>
<li>To send a transaction, enter the recipient&#39;s address next to <code>Recipient</code>and the amount you want to send next to <code>Amount</code>.</li>
<li>Because transactions on the TurtleCoin blockchain are privatized, in some situations a payment ID is necessary for the recipient to be able to determine where the payment came from, for instance when depositing to an exchange or other service.</li>
</ul>

<p>​        Usually the service/recipient will generate and provide the required payment ID.</p>

<p>​        To include a Payment ID, simply enter it next to <code>Payment ID</code>. <em>Note: It is optional, if it doesn&#39;t              give a payment ID it is most likely not required</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Next is the <code>Mixin</code>, which is how many times your transaction will be mixed with others for obfuscation and privacy. The suggested amount is <code>3</code>.</li>
<li>For the <code>Fee</code>, it is alright to leave it at <code>.1%</code>. If you send more than 1,000,000 TRTL at a time, it is best to set a fee of <code>1%</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once done, click <code>Send</code>.</p>
