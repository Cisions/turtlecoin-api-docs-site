<h1 id='rainborg-wat-dat'>RainBorg? Wat Dat?</h1>
<p>Back in the day, we had the <a href="Participating-in-Raindance">#raindance bot</a>, then people took advantage of the bot and it was retired. Now we have RainBorg!</p>

<p><img src="guides/images/rainborg/rainborg-avatar.png" width="194" height="208" alt="RainBorg Avatar" /></p>

<p>This bot monitors chat activity. Once a certain criterion is met, RainBorg sends out a tip using the tipbot, <a href="Using-trtlbot-plus-plus">trtlbot++</a>, to people who have recently been chatting away.</p>
<h2 id='what-is-the-criteria-to-get-tips'>What is the criteria to get tips?</h2>
<p>Basically, there is a tipping window <em>(min time/max time)</em> and chatting is monitored during that window. Those that &quot;chat&quot; during that time qualify and get added to a tip-list. </p>

<p>Once the list of people to be tipped reaches a threshold, and the timer has met its criteria, all the tips are issued to those on that list, woohoo!  </p>

<p>To avoid the system being taken advantage of, some specifics will be kept unknown to the public; only the bot operator and Ninjas will know how the bot&#39;s gears turn. </p>

<p>Simply participate in the chat and let RainBorg take care of the details, she knows what she&#39;s doing!</p>
<h2 id='why-does-this-exist'>Why does this exist?</h2>
<p>Because it is fun and promotes an active community; it is another way that this project is different.</p>
<h2 id='so-where-do-the-trtl-39-s-come-from'>So where do the TRTL&#39;s come from?</h2>
<p>They come from all the generous people in the community. There is a pool of TRTL, the pool is filled up by anyone that wants to contribute. You could be a contributor! It is anonymous and 100% philanthropic. </p>

<p>The only way it stops being anonymous is if you post in chat and disclose your donation.   <code>ha, just sent 350k TRTL to the RainBorg, megatip time yo!</code></p>
<h1 id='give-me-details'>Give me details!</h1>
<p>Right, to get started, simply register your wallet with <a href="Using-trtlbot-plus-plus#registering-your-wallet">trtlbot++</a>.</p>

<p>Go to the  <code>#wallets</code> channel in the <a href="https://discord.gg/J7g99EE">Discord server</a>, type <code>.registerwallet TRTL...</code>, and replace <code>TRTL...</code> with your wallet address. </p>

<p>For example, you would type:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>.registerwallet TRTLv3pFrFm2yk4cYNtKf5fxV1b594tNrZfEV2CYWJsTSqr9BWoWMrUNpQaeD9StrzQrxpRQKPCdd1FfvT6D6dAg4pY6iB7sqsG
</code></pre>
<p>That&#39;s it, you&#39;re in, now start chatting with your fellow Turtles.</p>
<h2 id='to-contribute-to-the-tip-rain-pool'>To contribute to the tip rain pool</h2>
<p>Send TRTL to this address</p>

<p><code>TRTLv12WtKJAzTNtxSkbcXf7mjeVApSqRYACtoJE2X52UBSce7qGAQ1JQgG3MmArnZSbkJXKqBXiPX2Mno7xD4tqD3p8SySoBc5</code></p>

<p>With this Payment ID <strong>!! IMPORTANT !!</strong></p>

<p><code>bca975edfe710a64337beb1685f32ab900989aa9767946efd8537f09db594bbd</code></p>

<p><em>No Payment ID equals a tip for the tipbot operator, it will not be donated to RainBorg.</em></p>
<h2 id='which-channels-does-this-work-with'>Which channels does this work with?</h2>
<p>The tips are sent out to participants in these channels.</p>

<ul>
<li>#general <em>(more tips sent here as this is the main channel)</em></li>
<li>#help <em>(everyone appreciates being helped, lend a hand, get some tips!)</em></li>
<li>#mining <em>(the miners are important, let&#39;s tip them as well)</em></li>
<li>#dev_general <em>(these guys, amiright!?)</em></li>
<li>#dev_marketing <em>(spread the word!)</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id='chatting-right-so-no-chat-no-trtl'>Chatting right? So no chat = no TRTL?</h2>
<p>Pretty much.<br>
- The active chatters get rained on.<br>
  - The inactive chatters don&#39;t.<br>
    - It&#39;s simple.  </p>
<h3 id='hold-up-i-was-active-like-2mins-ago-then-all-these-others-got-trtl-and-i-didn-39-t'>Hold up, I was active like 2mins ago then all these others got TRTL and I didn&#39;t</h3>
<p>Well, let&#39;s break this down then. You WERE active <em>(past tense)</em>, and the other people who ARE active got the rain and you didn&#39;t because of the way the chatting window works.  </p>

<p>They were active during the time RainBorg was raining down on the active Turtles. Active Turtles win, that&#39;s the game. Be a good active Turtle and she will share her tips with you!</p>
<h1 id='ok-ok-so-how-do-i-get-all-the-trtls-spam-exile'>OK OK, so how do I get all the TRTLs? SPAM? EXILE!</h1>
<p>This is not how it works or why it was set up... gaming the system or attempting to game the system could land you on the exile list.  </p>

<p>People on the exile list never get added to the tip-list. Focus on being an engaged member of the community and let the tip mistress, RainBorg, handle raining tips on the people, she is most capable.  </p>

<p>There is a way to get unsolicited tips though, <a href="https://medium.com/@turtlecoin/how-to-be-a-good-turtle-20a427028a18">be a good Turtle</a> and check out the tipbot, <a href="Using-trtlbot-plus-plus">trtlbot++</a>.</p>
<h1 id='commands'>Commands</h1>
<p>Yes she&#39;ll respond to <code>$</code> commands:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>$help</code> - you get a DM with a list of commands from RainBorg</li>
<li><code>$balance</code> - Check the bot&#39;s tip balance, will show in the channel</li>
<li><code>$donate</code> - you get a DM with details on how to send a donation to the bot&#39;s tip balance</li>
<li><code>$optout</code> - Opt out of receiving tips from the bot</li>
<li><code>$optin</code> - Opt back into receiving tips from the bot</li>
</ul>
<h1 id='stats'>Stats</h1>
<p>Every time RainBorg rains down tips on chatty Turtles she&#39;ll post a message in the #raindance channel.
They look something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<strong>TUT TUT</strong>
<p>Huzzah, 500 TRTL just rained on 4 chatty turtles in #mining, they each got 125 TRTL!</p>
<img src="guides/images/rainborg/rainborg-rain.png" width="256" height="256" alt="turtle in the rain" />
</blockquote>
<h1 id='anything-not-covered-here'>Anything not covered here?</h1>
<p>Open a <a href="https://github.com/turtlecoin/meta/issues/new?title=RainBorg+Question">new issue</a> or make some noise in #help.</p>

<p>The gaps will be filled either by you or another person, <a href="https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtlecoin-wiki">anyone can contribute</a> to these docs as well!</p>
<h4 id='wow-megatip-wat'>Wow? Megatip wat?</h4>
<p>An idea has been floated regarding a Megatip function. Basically, someone could purposely send a large chunk of TRTL and most of it would be sent out in the next wave of rain tips. </p>

<p>If you want to see something like this, talk about it! ;)</p>
