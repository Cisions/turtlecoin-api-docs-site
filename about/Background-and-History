<h1 id='how-and-why-was-turtlecoin-created'>How and Why was TurtleCoin Created?</h1>
<p>TurtleCoin was created on December 9th, 2017 by RockSteady and Bebop.</p>

<p>It was born from the idea that there were too many projects out there, which despite having no real product, were bringing in tons of funding. </p>

<p>TurtleCoin decided to do it the opposite way.
It&#39;s goal is to create a fun project which is easy to use and then let it grow on its own. 
We have a strong belief in our no-funding strategy; if we make a cool product, the value will create itself.</p>

<p>TurtleCoin was created with <strong>No</strong> Pre-Mine, <strong>No</strong> ICO, and <strong>No</strong> Shenanigans.</p>
<h1 id='our-background'>Our Background</h1>
<p>Most of us are full-time developers on other projects, and this is our way to give back to the community with something fun.</p>

<p>We also have a wide range of people in the community, people from all walks of life that contribute to the community one way or another. </p>

<p>Our community and dev team are growing by the week and this is what makes the TurtleCoin community so great!</p>
